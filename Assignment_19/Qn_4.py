''' Write a program which contains filter(), map() and reduce() in it. Python application which contains one list of nümbers.
 List contains the numbers which are accepted from user. Filter should filter out all such numbers which are even. 
 Map function will calculate its square. Reduce will return addition of all that numbers.
Input List [5, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 1, 2, 8, 10] 
List after filter [2, 4, 4, 2, 8, 10) 
List after map [4, 16, 16, 4, 64, 100]
Output of reduce = 204
'''

    # Step 2: Map - square of each number
    MData = list(map(lambda x: x * x, Fdata))
